Console Application Project in .NET 7 Demonstrating Software Design Patterns

In this project, we explore the practical application of various software design patterns within the .NET 7 framework to develop a highly efficient and modular console application. The selected patterns are carefully integrated to promote scalability, code reuse, and sustainable maintenance. The following are the applied design patterns:

Singleton: We implement the Singleton pattern to ensure that a class has only one instance throughout the application. This is especially useful for shared components, such as application configuration or database connection management.

Factory Method: We use the Factory Method pattern to encapsulate object creation and enable the creation of related object families without coupling code to concrete classes. This promotes flexibility and facilitates future expansion of functionalities.

Dependency Injection: We apply the Dependency Injection pattern to achieve better modularity and decoupling in our application. This allows us to inject external dependencies into classes rather than creating them internally, facilitating unit testing and flexibility in component management.

Repository: We implement the Repository pattern to separate data access logic from business logic. This helps centralize persistence operations and facilitates data management, improving maintainability and performance.

Unit of Work: We use the Unit of Work pattern to group related persistence operations into a single transaction. This ensures database consistency and facilitates rollback of changes in case of errors.

Strategy: We apply the Strategy pattern to define a family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulate them behind a common interface. This allows the application to dynamically change its behavior at runtime.

Builder: We implement the Builder pattern to facilitate the creation of complex objects step by step. This is useful when we want to create object instances with various configurations without overwhelming the code with constructor parameters.

State: We use the State pattern to model situations where an object's behavior changes based on its internal state. This improves code clarity and avoids multiple conditional statements.

In this project, each design pattern is consistently applied and integrated with the others, resulting in a console application in .NET 7 that is modular, maintainable, and highly adaptable to future expansions.
